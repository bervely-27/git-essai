                <p class="description">I am new to the programming world.I have started a week ago.At first,I thought I
                    could not make it through,may be I am still thinking that but I am putting myself into it
                    and I am trying my best to follow up the teacher's rythm.Now,I can write a little bit of html and
                    css.This a small advancement but not negligeable because that's THE begining of my journey to become
                    a skilled developer </p>
